                    <h2>406 Trades</h2>
                    <p>Role: Back-end Developer/Database Admin</p>
                    <p>406 Trades was a stock simulation application created by myself and 5 others. The website was written in Python using Flask. We used PyMongo to communicate with our MongoDB database to store users' account information. We used Alpaca API to get real-time stock information.</p>
                    <p>Users would create accounts and start off with some capital. They could then invest in different stocks and view their portfolio over time.</p>

                    <h2>Multiverse Adventure</h2>
                    <p>Role: Owner, Full-Stack Developer</p>
                    <p> Multiverse Adventure is a Roblox simulator/tycoon hybrid where players must advance through different worlds. All Roblox games are coded in LUA. I worked on creating 3D models for the game as well as scripting many core functional elements. We utilize client-server architecture to keep most of the work on Roblox servers to reduce the load on the clients. This allows users with under-powered computers to be able to enjoy our game.</p>

                    <h2>Arcade games in Python</h2>
                    <p>Developed different games in Python including Pong, Rock Paper Scissors, and Guess the Number. Pong was created using the Turtle Library to draw and animate the game. The Rock Paper Scissors game was created using TKinter to create a menu where players would click a button to select their choice and the result of the round would be displayed.</p>
