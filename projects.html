                    <h2>Winter Messages</h2>
                    <p>This project is a real-time chat application built using React and Firebase Firestore. It showcases my ability to create interactive and dynamic web applications with a focus on real-time data synchronization. The application allows users to engage in conversations, with each message update being instantly reflected across all connected clients. Utilizing Firebase's powerful backend services, the app handles user authentication and real-time database updates seamlessly. The project demonstrates my proficiency in using modern web development tools and frameworks to create a responsive and user-friendly chat interface.</p>

                    <h2>Toronto Kitty Cab</h2>
                    <p>Created a database management system using JavaScript and Oracle SQL with 2 other students. Users were able to create tables, populate tables, query the tables, drop tables, and view all the data inside a table. Users also had the ability to use their own custom querys. When viewing records, users were able to update data in the database easily with a user friendly UI. I focused on the backend of the website and creating the edit system. This project was done as the final project for CPS510: Database systems 1</p>

                    <h2>Art Higher or Lower</h2>
                    <p>Created a higher or lower game based on the price of popular paintings using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). When a user starts a game they are presented with 2 paintings and must click the higher or lower button based on the value of the painting. If they think the value of the painting on the left has a higher value than the painting on the right, they must click the higher button. This is still a work in progress and I hope to implement an account system and leaderboard system to keep track of the person with the longest streak. </p>

                    <h2>406 Trades</h2>
                    <p>Role: Back-end Developer/Database Admin</p>
                    <p>406 Trades was a stock simulation application created by myself and 5 others. The website was written in Python using Flask. We used PyMongo to communicate with our MongoDB database to store users' account information. We used Alpaca API to get real-time stock information.</p>
                    <p>Users would create accounts and start off with some capital. They could then invest in different stocks and view their portfolio over time.</p>

                    <h2>Multiverse Adventure</h2>
                    <p>Role: Owner, Full-Stack Developer</p>
                    <p>Multiverse Adventure is a Roblox simulator/tycoon hybrid where players must advance through different worlds. All Roblox games are coded in LUA. I worked on creating 3D models for the game as well as scripting many core functional elements. We utilize client-server architecture to keep most of the work on Roblox servers to reduce the load on the clients. This allows users with under-powered computers to be able to enjoy our game.</p>

                    <h2>Arcade games in Python</h2>
                    <p>Developed different games in Python including Pong, Rock Paper Scissors, and Guess the Number. Pong was created using the Turtle Library to draw and animate the game. The Rock Paper Scissors game was created using TKinter to create a menu where players would click a button to select their choice and the result of the round would be displayed.</p>

                    <h2>Obstacle course simulator</h2>
                    <p>Created an obstacle course where users would jump and progress through different levels. Users would reach a checkpoint at the end of each level and their progress was saved into a datastore. Players will also able to skip levels by paying a fee. Each time a player finished the entire obstacle course, they can restart the game but with increased speed and jump height.</p>

                    <h2>Infinity Obby</h2>
                    <p>Created an infinitely generating game where players must complete different stages to unlock higher difficulties. Stages of the game are procedurally generated and go on infinitely. I worked on creating the script that handels all of the player interactions with the stages. I 3D modeled all of the stages and the star islands which contain stars that allow players to skip stages. I designed a user-friendly UI that players can interact with to see their progress or change their difficulty.</p>
