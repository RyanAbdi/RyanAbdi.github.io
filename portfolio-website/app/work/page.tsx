                    CO-OP Software Developer | September 2024 - August 2025
                </h3>
                <p>
                    During my co-op term at <strong>WhoPlusYou</strong>, I
                    worked as a Software Developer on the{" "}
                    <strong>Home Team</strong>, where I contributed to building
                    and improving core features of the platform. My role
                    involved writing clean, maintainable code, collaborating
                    closely with designers and other developers, and
                    participating in agile development practices such as sprint
                    planning, daily stand-ups, and code reviews. I gained
                    hands-on experience with{" "}
                    <strong>SQL, Vue.js, and Laravel</strong>, strengthened my
                    problem-solving skills, and learned how to deliver
                    user-focused solutions in a fast-paced, team-oriented
                    environment.
                    <br />
                    <br />I had the opportunity to work on a variety of
                    projects, including the{" "}
                    <strong>Organization Information Sharing</strong>{" "}
                    initiative. This project required implementing a
                    notification system to alert users when their information
                    was being shared with different organizations. I was
                    involved in both the design and implementation phases,
                    ensuring the system was reliable, secure, and easy for users
                    to understand. Through this project, I deepened my
                    understanding of data handling and user privacy while also
                    gaining experience in translating business requirements into
                    practical technical solutions.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    As a Software Engineer Intern at Aisha Home Services, I had
                    the opportunity to step into a leadership role by leading my
                    own development team and mentoring fellow interns. I was
                    responsible for coordinating project tasks, providing
                    technical training, and ensuring best practices were
                    followed throughout the development process. Alongside
                    leadership responsibilities, I contributed directly to the
                    codebase, building features with React on the front end and
                    Django on the back end to improve performance and user
                    experience. This experience not only strengthened my
                    technical expertise but also helped me develop valuable
                    leadership, communication, and team management skills.
